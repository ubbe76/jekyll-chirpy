The procedure I used installing Jekyll on Ubuntu 24.04 with Nginx.  
There are several ways in doing this but this is how I did it.

See the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/">official documentation</a> for details.

1. Installing Jekyll

    Like always, start by updating.

    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```
    {: .nolineno }

    Then install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
    ```
    {: .nolineno }

    To add environment variables to your `~/.bashrc`, run:

    > Don't run this as root.
    {: .prompt-warning }

    ```shell
    echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    {: .nolineno }

    Run the following from your home directory:
    ```shell
    gem install jekyll bundler
    ```

    That's all for the installation part.

2. Setup Jekyll
    
    To start a new Jekyll website in ./mysite run:
    
    ```shell
    jekyll new mysite
    ```
    `mysite` is just an example. It can pretty much be anything you want.
    
    Enter the directory created:
    
    ```shell
    cd mysite
    ```
    
    To develop and see the changes in real-time, run
    
    ```shell
    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
    ```
    
    This will start hosting your site on <http://localhost:4000>.  
    The `--livereload` automatically refreshes the page on changes.

    Visit the creator of this great theme to find out more <https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/>.  
    He covers more detail in how to actually use Jekyll for your new site.  
    And as mentioned earlier, the official documentation is found at <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/>.

3. Install and setup Nginx to serve the finished website.

    ```shell
    sudo apt install nginx
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    sudo systemctl enable nginx
    ```

    Inside the directory we created the site earlier, there's a directory called `_site/`.  
    This is where the finished site ends up after running `jekyll build`.  
    This is also from where I serve the website with Nginx.
